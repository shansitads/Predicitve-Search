# Predictive Searching Algorithm
A test for @shansitads 's predictiveSearch algorithm
in case you are reading this,the argonAlgo is my implementation which (Suprisingly) works I am kind got interested as I had never made my  own interpolation method and it somehow worked....<br>
The shansitaAlgo is your implementation I refactored your code a little and I removed the math.round because that gave a wrong feel that your numbers were being searched
