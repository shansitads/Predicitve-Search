# Predictive Searching Algorithm
### A test for @shansitads 's predictiveSearch algorithm <br>
in case you are reading this,I am sorry the UI is A grade trash I suck at those<br>The argonAlgo is my implementation which (Surprisingly) works I kind of got interested as I had never made my  own interpolation method and it somehow worked....<br>
The shansitaAlgo is your implementation I refactored your code a little and I removed the math.round because that gave a wrong feel that your numbers were being searched
