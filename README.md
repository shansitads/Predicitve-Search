# Predicitve-Search
This is an adaptation of the binary searching method for arrays, written in Java. It is faster than binary searching for most arrays used as it predicts the position of the element in the array. I have used Scanner class and bubble sort method to take the input for the array and sort it. The code for predictive searching is under the function "search".
